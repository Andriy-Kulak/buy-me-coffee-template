# Buy Me A Coffee Hardhat Project

- We created a template so that you can follow along the tutorial without running into dependency issues with newer vs slightly older hardhat versions.
- to install dependencies, make sure you have node and npm installed and then run `npm i`


This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

On Top Of that, we added Next.js (a popular React framework), to help you interact with the contract on front-end. Don't worry about mastering Next.js, we mainly want you to focus on the principles of connecting your wallet and interacting with the contract which are mostly the same no matter which framework you use.

The tutorial uses replit, but for the purposes of this assignment, please add it to your code within this repo!

To start the front-end, run the following:
- `npm run dev`
